# Basalt
The Basalt Engine is a high-performance web-based game engine built on top of Babylon.js, designed to rival the workflow and "feel" of Source 1 while utilizing modern mesh-based editing. While The Iron Will Pipeline serves as the bridge, transforming Blender into a professional-grade map editor and entity manager.
